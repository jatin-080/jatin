# 🌐 Jatin Kumar's Personal Website

Hey there! Welcome to the source code of my personal website — built to reflect who I am, what I do, and what I aim to become.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a fully responsive personal portfolio website made to:
- Showcase my skills, projects, and journey
- Serve as a digital resume and contact point
- Share insights, blogs, or experiments (coming soon!)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript  
- *(or React/Tailwind if you're using that – let me know, I'll modify)*
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel *(whichever you used)*
